# VTPLSTM
Inspired by the performence of Social LSTM. I created a model that could predict vehicle's trajectory in 5s. The model uses LSTM as center. I trained it at NGSIM. Still fix it...


1.DownLoad NGSIM dataset(.csv)
2.Fix parameters in parameters.py
3.Extract dataset by data_generator.py
4.Train it (fix model by parameters.py)
5.visualize by visualdl and visuallize

I will complete this project in the next month.
